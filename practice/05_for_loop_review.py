Workbooks are easier to work with if you remember looping through nested lists.
This is a review

'''

# 1. PRINT OUT EACH ELEMENT IN LIST
# Print out each element in the example_list variable
example_list = ["Hello", "this", "is", "a", "list"]


# 2. PRINT OUT EACH ELEMENT IN LIST 2
# Print out each element in example_list_2. What is each element?
example_list_2 = [["first", "list", "inside", "list"], ["second", "list", "inside", "list"], ["third", "list", "inside", "list"]]


# 3. PRINT OUT THE FIRST ELEMENT OF EACH INNER ELEMENT:
# Using example_list_2, print out the first element of each inner list:


# 4. PRINT OUT EACH INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT OF EACH INNER ELEMENT
